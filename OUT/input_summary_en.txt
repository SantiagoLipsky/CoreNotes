Here is the summary:

**What is UML?**

UML stands for Unified Modeling Language, a standardized way to visualize, construct, and document software systems using diagrams.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Object-Oriented**: UML represents systems as objects with properties and behaviors.
2. **Modeling**: UML models describe the structure and behavior of a system.
3. **Diagrams**: Various types of diagrams (e.g., class, sequence, state) help communicate complex ideas.

**Example:**

Suppose we're designing an e-commerce website. We create a class diagram showing:
* Classes (Customer, Order, Product)
* Attributes (name, email, price)
* Relationships ( customer places order, product is ordered)

This visual representation helps stakeholders understand the system's structure and behavior.

**Note:** This summary only scratches the surface of UML. For a more in-depth understanding, I recommend exploring resources on object-oriented design, modeling languages, and software engineering.
